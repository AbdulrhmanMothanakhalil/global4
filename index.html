            <h2>global Warming</h2>
            <p>Global warming is the long-term warming of the planet’s overall temperature. Though this warming trend has been going on for a long time, its pace has significantly increased in the last hundred years due to the burning of fossil fuels. As the human population has increased, so has the volume of fossil fuels burned. Fossil fuels include coal, oil, and natural gas, and burning them causes what is known as the “greenhouse effect” in Earth’s atmosphere.

                The greenhouse effect is when the sun’s rays penetrate the atmosphere, but when that heat is reflected off the surface cannot escape back into space. </p>

            <h2>global Warming solution</h2>
            <p>Reduce, reuse, and recycle: In the United States, the average person generates 4.5 pounds of trash every day. Fortunately, not all the items we discard end up in landfills; we recycle or compost more than one-third of our trash. In 2014 this saved carbon emissions equivalent to the yearly output of 38 million passenger cars. But we could be doing so much more. “Reduce should always be the number-one priority,” says NRDC senior resource specialist Darby Hoover. And to reap the environmental benefits of “recyclable” goods, you must recycle according to the rules of your municipality, since systems vary widely by location.</p>

            <h2>How is the climate in the Netherlands changing?</h2>
            <p>Global warming is causing more changes in the climate. These changes are also manifest in the Netherlands. For example, we are increasingly faced with drought and severe precipitation. Cases in point are the extreme droughts of 2018 and 2019, and the flooding caused by torrential rain in the summer of 2021. Our climate is turning ever more extreme, Summers are growing warmer, and the probability of heatwaves is increasing. Heatwaves occur ever more frequently and last ever longer.</p>
